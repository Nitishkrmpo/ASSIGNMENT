Idea Management Application
Overview
The Idea Management Application is a web-based platform that allows users to submit, view, update, and delete innovative ideas. Built using the Flask framework with MySQL as the database, this application implements RESTful API endpoints to handle idea management and filtering efficiently. The app supports robust data handling with validation, error management, and efficient routing.

Key Features
CRUD Operations: Create, read, update, and delete ideas through RESTful API endpoints.
Filter Ideas: Query parameters allow users to filter ideas by attributes like idea_author.
Data Persistence: Ideas are stored in a MySQL database for efficient data retrieval and storage.
Postman Tested: APIs were tested using Postman to ensure seamless communication and proper functionality.
Error Handling: Built-in mechanisms to handle input validation and prevent invalid data submissions.
Technologies Used
Flask (Python Framework)
MySQL (Database)
HTML, CSS (Frontend)
Postman (API Testing)
RESTful API (Backend)

API Endpoints
GET /ideaapp/api/v1/ideas: Fetch all ideas.
GET /ideaapp/api/v1/ideas?idea_author={author}: Filter ideas by author.
POST /ideaapp/api/v1/ideas: Create a new idea.
GET /ideaapp/api/v1/ideas/<idea_id>: Fetch an idea by ID.
PUT /ideaapp/api/v1/ideas/<idea_id>: Update an idea by ID.
DELETE /ideaapp/api/v1/ideas/<idea_id>: Delete an idea by ID.
Testing with Postman
Import the Postman collection provided in the repo or manually test each API by sending appropriate requests.
Ensure that you are sending JSON data in the POST and PUT requests.
Future Enhancements
Implement user authentication and authorization.
Add front-end framework support (e.g., React or Vue.js) for a richer user interface.
Integrate caching mechanisms for faster data retrieval.
